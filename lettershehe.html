                                Hi!! hihihihi <br><br>
                                To clarify things, I am here to tell you things that might shock you.🤯🤯  <br><br>
                                First of all, I just wanted to say it na, VERY VERY GUSTO KO NAGD MA TELL NI! I’m confessing for my own sake, please do understand me.🥹 <br><br>
                                I don’t know if it’s obvious, but I think (THINK!) I might have a crush on u (WAIT NA CRINGEAN KO AHAY 😭😭😭😭😭) Please understand me (as an aromantic person) it literally took me 2 YEARS to admit this TO MYSELF! <br><br>
                                I kept on denying (until now) pero I got so fed up hahahah 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 I do understand that you have feelings for someone and I respect it (SO MUCH!) and I support you also!! I really just wanted to tell you this because I wanted to get over it na ahhahahaha <br><br>
                                In 8th grade, I wrote (almost finished 3 chapters) of a story 😭 (cringe cringe ahay) about my dreams about you and also ABOUT YOU. (NDE KO NAGD KAYA NA CRINGE GD KO YA) <br><br>
                                I think I also predicted before that you had a crush on someone else and I was right 😭😭🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 (Lian and Shek knows abt this, the story that I wrote pero wla ko gin pa read sa ila) <br><br>
                                2023, almost na ta maging grade 9, that’s where I literally forced myself to stop my NEUGEUEGUE sa imo (I STILL AM 😭) and it was because you said it yourself na (✌🏻)!! pero still I really understand!! <br><br>
                                In 9th grade……. <br><br>
                                hahahaha….. <br><br>
                                My uncanny adoration to you never got away…. <br><br>
                                I DONT KNOW WY 😭😭😭 PLEASE SAVE ME 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 <br><br>
                                In February, 2024, that’s where gn admit ko na to myself na I had an ano on you ah (AY AMBOT DA NA CRINGE GD O Y😭) <br><br>
                                I’m not looking forward to anything, I just really wanted to express what I feel, liking you feels so frustrating (it’s not your fault) and I don’t expect things to happen 😭🙏🏻🙏🏻 <br><br>
                                I don’t even know why I learned how to code for you 😭 I learned it in just one night and then right now I don’t even know what I’m doing 😭 <br><br>
                                I even asked help from my brother (Kyrwin) and bothered him SOO MANY times because I was so lost😭😭 He kept on pushing me to confess my feelings to you because he witnessed that I was so frustrated hahahaha… <br><br>
                                If only you weren’t one of my closest friends I would have no problem confessing to you pero ALMOST 3 YEARS NAKO NAGA BINOANG JUST BECAUSE ND KO GUSTO MA RUINANG FRIENDSHIP OKAY!!! I really hope things won’t get weird huhuhuhuhu <br><br>
                                I made this website because I wanted to learn… and I wanted to express my ahhahahaa so nd ko man gani gets ngaa gn himo ko ni 😭🙏🏻 <br><br>
                                Please please please don’t view me differently🙏🏻🙏🏻 <br><br>
                                Also when I was telling you nga I had a crush on you in 8th grade it was a test to see how you would react if ever I confessed jendiwnsjw and seeing the results it made me to step back once again hahaha pero right now since I’m so frustrated I had to gather up the courage to do this 😭🙏🏻 <br><br>
                                I even planned on confessing to you in graduation (next year) pero my feelings cannot wait anymore 🥹🙏🏻 I want it to go away na 🥹🙏🏻 <br><br>
                                I feel like I’m not myself anymore because I get to do things that were so unique and unlike me, just like learning how to code for you😭🙏🏻😭🙏🏻😭 please this was the craziest so far 😭😭 <br><br>
                                I’m so informal I apologize for that but I can never take this seriously 😭🙏🏻🙏🏻😭🙏🏻😭🙏🏻😭🙏🏻😭🙏🏻😭🙏🏻 <br><br> My letter isn’t that impactful, but hopefully I will get to tell you everything one day:) I just wanted to ease my mind and be free 🥹🥹 <br><br>
